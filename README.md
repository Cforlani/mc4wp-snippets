# MailChimp for WP Snippets
This is a repository of code snippets that help modify the default behaviour of [MailChimp for WordPress](https://mc4wp.com/) &amp; its [Add-ons](https://mc4wp.com/add-ons/).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.


## Using Snippets

Most files in this library contain code that you can add to the functions.php of your active theme unless stated otherwise. 

1. Click on the filename of the snippet you'd like to use.
2. Click the "Raw" button (next to "Blame" and "History") at the top right.
3. Copy the code and add it to the end of a file titled "functions.php" inside your active themes folder.
